<summary><strong>Laboratory 1:</strong> Create a C program to find the sum of `n` natural numbers, compile it using the GCC compiler, and verify the output after execution.</summary>

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

**Step 1:** Create a new `sum1ton.c` file in the specified directory (asic_flow) in a Linux environment using gedit editor.

Save your C program

**Step 2:** Compile the source code `sum1ton.c` using gcc compiler (`gcc sum1ton.c`) which will generate an executable a.out file. Run the executable file(`./a.out`) in terminal window to view the output.

**Observation** Sum of first 100 natural numbers come out to be 5050

<summary><strong>Laboratory 2:</strong> Compile the C program developed in Laboratory 1 using the RISCV compiler.</summary>

### Step-by-Step Procedure:

# **Compilation using O1 flag**

**Step 1:** Compile `sum1ton.c` using RISCV Compiler using the command given below
```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-gcc -O1 -mabi=lp64-march=rv64i -o sum1ton.o  sum1ton.c
```
Also to check whether sum1ton.o has been created or not type the following command
```bash
ls -ltr sum1ton.o
```

**Step 2:** To generate the assembly code of the c program written type the following command in a new terminal window
```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o
```
![Step 1](./Lab1/4.png)

![Step 1](./Lab1/6.png)
It will give a bunch of assembly language code

**Step 3:** Use pipe less command with the command used in step 2 as shown below which allows us to scroll through the output interactively.

```bash
riscv64-unknown-elf-objdump -d sum1ton.o | less
```
The assembly version of the C program is displayed. Type /main to navigate to the section of the code related to the main function (int main()).

![Step 1](./Lab1/8.png)

- To determine the number of instructions in the "main" section, you can either count each instruction individually or use an alternative method: subtract the address of the first instruction in the subsequent section from the address of the first instruction in the "main" section. Then, divide the result by 4, as each instruction occupies 4 bytes in a byte-addressable memory system.

![Step 1](./Lab1/10.jpg)

- No of instructions in the main function comes out to be (0x101C0 - 0x10184)/4 = 0x3C/4 = 0xF = 15 instructions
